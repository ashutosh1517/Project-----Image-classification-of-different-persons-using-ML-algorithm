# Project-----Image-classification-of-different-persons-using-ML-algorithm

Objective - Classification of images using Machine learning algorithms

- Performed Data pre-processing (data cleaning using openCV face detection, feature engineering using wavelet
transforms, data visualization using matplotlib & making the Data ready for model training). Implemented some
Classification algorithms, SVC, Random Forest, LR, KNN, GaussianNB. Developed the model with the best scoring
algorithm (on test-data), fine-tuned model parameters using gridsearchCV and saved the model using joblib.
